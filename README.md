# House Price Prediction Using Regression and Random Forest Models

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using various features of the property, including square footage, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and other related characteristics. We employed both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models to predict prices and improve prediction accuracy through feature selection and model tuning.

## Files Included
- `house_price_prediction.py`: The main script for data cleaning, analysis, and model training.
- `data_assignment2.csv`: The dataset used in the analysis (if allowed to share).
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries required to run the project.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**: Handled missing values, data types, and standardized features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized key features and their relationships with house prices.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identified important features such as `sqft_living`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, and `sqft_above`.
4. **Modeling**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regression
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using MSE and R-squared metrics.
